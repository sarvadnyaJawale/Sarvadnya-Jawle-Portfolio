# üö™ Introduction

Looking for a job should indeed be considered a job in itself. Regardless of how pessimistic the previous statement might sound, I've never experienced something as depressing, draining, and exhausting as trying to find _something_, whatever it is, wherever it is.

Certificates. Trainings. Degrees. We have a huge vested interest in them, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. I am not denying the inherent truth of it, though; a solid education is a pretty easy thing to carry around, yet our approach to education requires a deep reform. Similarly, the lack of educational and professional opportunities should be discussed and addressed, but that's a story for another night. Today, we'll focus on the importance of portfolios, which may significantly define our success while trying to find an opportunity.

# üîÆ Features

Similarly to many other examples that have become extremely popular these days, I decided to organize this portfolio following the structure of a **landing page** - and believe me when I say that back in the day, landing pages triggered some of my worst nightmares as someone just getting started!

Those, however, were extremely simple yet not functional at all. Beautiful? Yes. A blank page? Yes, again. That's definitely not the case occupying us today, though.

## üåí Day'n'Nite

Just as it's mandatory these days, I incorporated a **theme switcher** to enhance the visual appeal for readers and nocturnal creatures of the interwebz, which will hopefully allow users to personalize their viewing experience based on their preferences.

![Light-Mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e3f48eb-828b-469f-84dc-564fc752ad46)

![Dark-Mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b8d53cf-2e9c-4dfb-8c9d-1a4a7075bf91)


## üì¨ EmailJS

What makes ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a11e86aa-b578-4635-b29f-aecc801475a7)
 great is the fact that it keeps things simple. This beautiful tool helps to send emails using client-side technologies only. No server is required ‚Äì just connect EmailJS to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use one of their SDK libraries to trigger an email. Boom! That's it!

In case you are curious about the implementation itself, don't hesitate to inspect the [main.js file](/js/main.js):

```javascript
/* Mail integration */
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID")
})

document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault()

  emailjs.sendForm('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', this)
    .then(function(response) {
      console.log('Success!', response.status, response.text)
      alert('Email sent successfully!')
      document.getElementById('contact-form').reset()
    }, function(error) {
      console.log('Failed...', error)
      alert('Email sending failed.')
    })
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Needless to say, the [original documentation](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) is worth your time, guys - but as you can see, integrating EmailJS into your project couldn't be easier!

## üìú Single page

Truth said, one of the factors allowing me to realize that I'm indeed _evolving into the Lola Flores of the coding sector_ is that now, I can tell when I should (or shouldn't) overcomplicate my life. As programmers, our main goal is solving problems - and not all issues require the same tools, not even intricate ones.

In this case, the idea I had in mind was simple: a clean, minimalist, compact portfolio allowing users to get a clear insight into who Maria _is_ as a professional. That's why, independently of my toxic relationship with React, NextJS, or Astro, I chose my best warriors: the tools that started it all. My coding roots, so to speak.

## üñºÔ∏è Swiper

Swiper is considered one of the most modern free and open-source mobile touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions - websites, web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps are no exception!
