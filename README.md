# 🔮 Features
## 🌒 Automated Security Scanning with Trivy Operator
I integrated Trivy Operator into my AWS EKS Cluster for continuous vulnerability scanning. It automates the detection of security issues across containers and Kubernetes resources. Here's how it helps:

1. Continuous Monitoring: Trivy continuously monitors the EKS cluster for vulnerabilities in images and workloads.
2. Custom Dashboard: Using Streamlit and Python, I built a dashboard to visualize vulnerabilities by severity and namespace, making it easy to track and prioritize fixes.
3. Real-time Alerts: When a critical vulnerability is detected, Alertmanager sends notifications via Slack for quick action.

## 🚀 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
I used Terraform to provision resources such as VPC, EC2 instances, ALB, and RDS. All infrastructure is managed as code, ensuring consistency, scalability, and version control.

## 📜 Kubernetes Manifests
All Kubernetes manifests for deployments, services, ingresses, and ConfigMaps are hosted in the /k8s-manifests directory, showcasing how to deploy secure, scalable applications.

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability
Implemented Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics visualization, and integrated Trivy for security monitoring, creating a complete DevOps monitoring stack.

This README file demonstrates not only my technical expertise but also my commitment to creating robust, production-ready infrastructure. 🚀
